            "But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.",

With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?\r\nThe answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.", 
            "Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.",

            "In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.",

            "And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.", 
            "But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.",

            "Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.",

            "Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.",

            "The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.",

            "In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced U.", 
            "We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.", 
            "Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.", 
            "The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ? especially special forces ? who are deployed with Iraqi as units advisers.", 
            "In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.", 
            "Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.",

            "Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.", 
            "But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ? that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.", 
            "The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.", 
            "In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.", 
            "And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ? especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ? do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.", 
            "The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.", 
            "If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.",

            "But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.", 
            "Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.", 
            "Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.", 
            "And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.", 
            "For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion.", 
            "Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.", 
            "In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.", 
            "And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.", 
            "We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.", 
            "My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.", 
            "In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled.", 
            "While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.", 
            "For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.", 
            "Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.", 
            "Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.",

            "No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ? and that strategy must change.",

            "To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.", 
            "Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ? military, financial, diplomatic ? to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.", 
            "The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ? a phased redeployment of U.", 
            "When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.", 
            "We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.", 
            "Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.", 
            "The President\u2019s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.", 
            "As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.", 
            "troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.", 
            "force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time.", 
            "We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.", 
            "The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ? especially special forces ? who are deployed with Iraqi as units advisers.",

            "Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.", 
            "osed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.", 
            "The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.", 
            "But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.", 
            "This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.", 
            "But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.", 
            "Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.",

            "The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.", 
            "We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.", 
            "It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.", 
            "This brings me to a set of broader points.", 
            "Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.", 
            "But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ? that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.", 
            "And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.",

            "And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ? especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ? do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.", 
            "Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.", 
            "Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable.", 
            "of many nations.", 
            "The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we\u2019re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we\u2019re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.", 
            "The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we\u2019d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.",

            "Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.",

With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?\r\nThe answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.",

            "For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.", 
            "In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.", 
            "Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.",

            "Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.", 
            "But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.", 
            "One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.", 
            "Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.",

            "While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.",

            "Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.",

            "Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.", 
            "The President\u2019s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.",

            "In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.",

            "So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.", 
            "But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.",

            "This means no more bloated no-bid contracts that cost the taxpayers millions in overhead and administrative expenses.", 
            "But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.",

            "But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ? that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.", 
            "And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.", 
            "The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.", 
            "In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.", 
            "This doesn\u2019t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it\u2019s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.", 
            "And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ? especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ? do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.", 
            "The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.", 
            "Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable.", 
            "If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.", 
            "We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.", 
            "But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.", 
            "This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.", 
            "We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ? threats we haven\u2019t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.", 
            "The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we\u2019re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we\u2019re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.", 
            "And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.", 
            "There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ? and that is the loss of our government\u2019s credibility with the American people.",

With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?\r\nThe answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.",

            "For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.", 
            "In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.",

            "We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.", 
            "But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.",

            "But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.",

With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?\r\nThe answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.", 
            "Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.",

            "It is in our national interest to prevent this from happening.", 
            "We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.", 
            "It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.", 
            "This brings me to a set of broader points.", 
            "Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.", 
            "But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ? that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.", 
            "And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.", 
            "The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.", 
            "In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.", 
            "This doesn\u2019t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it\u2019s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.", 
            "And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ? especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ? do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.", 
            "The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.", 
            "Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.", 
            "Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable.", 
            "If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.", 
            "But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.", 
            "This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.", 
            "We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ? threats we haven\u2019t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.", 
            "The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we\u2019re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we\u2019re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.", 
            "The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we\u2019d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.",

            "The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.",

            "In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.", 
            "In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.", 
            "Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.", 
            "At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few.",

            "Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.", 
            "Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.", 
            "And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.", 
            "But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.",

            "This doesn\u2019t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it\u2019s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.",

            "And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ? especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ? do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.", 
            "Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.", 
            "If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.", 
            "We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.", 
            "But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.", 
            "We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ? threats we haven\u2019t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.", 
            "The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we\u2019re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we\u2019re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.", 
            "But there are many others.", 
            "The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we\u2019d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.", 
            "And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.", 
            "There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ? and that is the loss of our government\u2019s credibility with the American people.", 
            "According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.",

            "But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ? a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.", 
            "It\u2019s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.", 
            "I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.",

            "As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.", 
            "Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.", 
            "This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program.",

            "She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying.", 
            "Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax.", 
            "Others, the plague.",

            "He looked at me and said, \"Been there, done that.", 
            "\"\r\nOf course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.", 
            "But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.", 
            "Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs.", 
            "ists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.", 
            "We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.", 
            "Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.", 
            "And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.", 
            "Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.", 
            "y is, what is the future of this program? With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?\r\nThe answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.", 
            "First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States.", 
            "The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.",

            "For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.", 
            "Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.", 
            "In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.", 
            "In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.", 
            "Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.", 
            "At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few.",

            "\"\r\nBesides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.",

            "Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.", 
            "Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.", 
            "ss the former Soviet Union.", 
            "And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.", 
            "But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.", 
            "We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.", 
            "One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.", 
            "Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.", 
            "ealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats.", 
            "My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.", 
            "On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.", 
            "While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.", 
            "But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.", 
            "For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.", 
            "Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.", 
            "Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces.", 
            "Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.", 
            "But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.", 
            "-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.",

            "Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.", 
            "Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.", 
            "I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly.", 
            "But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.", 
            "It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs.", 
            "But lately we haven't seen many of these visits.", 
            "We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.", 
            "And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.", 
            "There is no doubt that there is a tough road ahead.", 
            "But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.", 
            "\"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved.",
